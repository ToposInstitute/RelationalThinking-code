# Define the primitive systems #
# Each person's mood level is a number in the interval [-5, 5] 
# -5 is uber grumpy
# +5 is uber excited 
#  0 is neutral

# Each person has a susceptability_factor [0,1] caputring the susceptibility of other person's mood during an interaction
# Each person has a calmDown_factor [0,1] capturing the rate at which they approach the neutral state if by themselves (no interaction) 
# When each person has reached their maximum grumpiness or maximum excitment, the external connection breaks, Lets call this mood_tolerance 

# change_in_mood = external_mood * susceptability - mood * calmdown_rate (if mood > gumpiness_tolerance and mood < excitement_tolreance)
# This model has a major flaw, suppose the tolerance limit is reached, then the connection is broken only for the person whose tolerance limit 
# has been reached. The other person is still affected by and the connection is not broken at his/her end. This makes no sense. The connection 
# must be treated as a shared resource which is either available to both or unavailable to both simultaneously.
